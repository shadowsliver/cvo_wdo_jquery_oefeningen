            <h2>League of Shadows</h2>
            <p>We have purged your fear. You are ready to Iead these men. You are ready to become a member of the League of Shadows. But first, you must demonstrate your commitment to justice.</p>
            <p>When a forest grows too wild, a purging fire is inevitable and natural. Tomorrow the world will watch in horror as its greatest city destroys itself. The movement back to harmony will be unstoppable this time.</p>
            <p>I can't do that as Bruce Wayne... as a man. I'm flesh and blood. I can be ignored, destroyed. But as a symbol, I can be incorruptible, I can be everlasting.</p>
            <p>Gotham's been good to our family, but the city's been suffering. People less fortunate than us have been enduring very hard times. So we built a new, cheap, public transportation system to unite the city. And at the center, Wayne tower.</p>
            <p>Look around you. You'll see two councilmen, a union official, couple off-duty cops and a judge. I wouldn't have a second's hesitation of blowing your head off in front of them. Now, that's power you can't buy. That's the power of fear.</p>
            <p>Breathe in your fears. Face them. To conquer fear, you must become fear. You must bask in the fear of other men. And men fear most what they cannot see. You have to become a terrible thought. A wraith. You have to become an idea! Feel terror cloud your senses. Feel its power to distort. To control. And know that this power can be yours. Embrace your worst fear. Become one with the darkness.</p>
            <p>But I know the rage that drives you. That impossible anger strangIing the grief until the memory of your loved one is just poison in your veins. And one day, you catch yourself wishing the person you loved had never existed so you'd be spared your pain.</p>

            <h2>You have inspired good.</h2>
            <p>But you spat in the faces of Gotham's criminals. Didn't you think there might be casualties? Things always get worse before they get better.</p>
            <p>You want order in Gotham. Batman must take off his mask and turn himself in. Oh, and every day he doesn't, people will die. Starting tonight. I'm a man of my word.</p>
            <p>Let me get this straight. You think that your client, one of the wealthiest, most powerful men in the world is secretly a vigilante who spends his nights beating criminals to a pulp with his bare hands and your plan is to blackmail this person? Good luck.</p>
            <p>Introduce a little anarchy, upset the established order and everything becomes chaos. I'm an agent of chaos. Oh, and you know the thing about chaos? It's fair.</p>
            <p>When their enemies were at the gates the Romans would suspend democracy and appoint one man to protect the city. It wasn't considered an honor, it was a public service.</p>
            <p>Because some men aren't looking for anything logical, like money. They can't be bought, bullied, reasoned or negotiated with. Some men just wanna watch the world burn.</p>
            <p>Do you wanna know why I use a knife? Guns are too quick. You can't savor all the... little emotions. You see, in their last moments, people show you who they really are. So in a way, I knew your friends better than you ever did. Would you like to know which of them were cowards?</p>

            <h2>Hero can be anyone.</h2>
            <p>Even a man knowing something as simple and reassuring as putting a coat around a young boy shoulders to let him know the world hadn't ended.</p>
            <p>Every year, I took a holiday. I went to Florence, this cafe on the banks of the Arno. Every fine evening, I would sit there and order a Fernet Branca. I had this fantasy, that I would look across the tables and I would see you there with a wife maybe a couple of kids. You wouldn't say anything to me, nor me to you. But we would both know that you've made it, that you were happy. I never wanted you to come back to Gotham. I always knew there was nothing here for you except pain and tragedy and I wanted something more for you than that. I still do.</p>
            <p>There's a storm coming, Mr. Wayne. You and your friends better batten down the hatches, because when it hits, you're all going to wonder how you ever thought you could live so large and leave so little for the rest of us.</p>
            <p>But a man who doesn't care about the world doesn't spend half his fortune on a plan to save it. And isn't so wounded when it fails that he goes into hiding.</p>
            <p>I climbed out of the pit. I found my father and brought him back to exact terrible vengeance. But by that time, the prisoners and the doctor had their work to my friend, my protector. The League took us in and trained us but my father could not accept Bane. He saw only a monster, whose very existence was the reminder of the hell he'd left his wife to die in. He excommunicated Bane from the League of Shadows. His only crime was that he loved me. I could not forgive my father, until you murdered him.</p>
